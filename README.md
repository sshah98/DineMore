# GW Dining Tracker

What to do:

The goal is to provide a way for students to input their current balance. The program will track user spending with input of the place they bought and the money they spent (will need to be changed later because many students don't actually get receipts or care how much money they spent at one time)

The application starts off with the input value of the current balance of the student




How can I start creating app:

Scrape data from gw dining about vendors that accept gworld
Try and find prices of food at these places
Try and aggregate data with data about dining deals

Move on from there


ANOTHER IDEA:
Put all of the data on this website, https://dining.gwu.edu/where-eat
and this one https://dining.gwu.edu/meal-deals-discounts
in excel file. Then focus on finding an algorithm or way to determine cost efficiency and saving measures
